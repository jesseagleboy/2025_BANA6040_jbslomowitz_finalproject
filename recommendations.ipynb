        "- This is **simulated data for educational purposes** - not real customer data\n",
        "- Analysis covers only one year - seasonal patterns may not be fully captured\n",
        "- We don't have product category detail - can't distinguish premium vs. budget items\n",
        "- Missing some demographic information (some households have null values)\n",

        "### Methodological Limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "- We used simple quartile-based segmentation - more sophisticated clustering could reveal additional segments\n",
        "- We didn't account for customer lifetime value or churn risk\n",
