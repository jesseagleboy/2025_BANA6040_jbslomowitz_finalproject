        "# Executive Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "**Business Question:** Are our promotion-heavy customers high-value \"smart shoppers\" who drive revenue, or low-margin \"cherry-pickers\" who erode profits?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Findings:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **The Promotion Paradox:** Promotion-heavy customers spend 19% more annually ($2,092 vs $1,757) but buy 33% cheaper items ($0.92 vs $1.37 per unit). When controlled for spending level, promo-light high-spenders actually have 6% higher basket values ($45.10 vs $42.26), revealing a classic Simpson's Paradox.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Margin Killers Outnumber Smart Shoppers 2:1:** We identified 238 \"smart shoppers\" (9.6%) who combine high promotion usage with high spending. However, they're outnumbered by 529 \"margin killers\" (21.4%) who use promotions heavily but maintain low basket values ($28.48).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Missing the Affluent Customer:** Only 9.1% of 250K+ income households are promo-heavy, compared to 46.4% of 50-74K households. We're successfully attracting budget-constrained necessity shoppers but missing affluent discretionary spenders entirely.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Highest Value Customers Don't Need Promotions:** The \"Untapped Potential\" segment (380 households, 15.4%) maintains the highest basket values ($45.10) with minimal promotion usage, proving that high value exists without heavy discounting.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reduce overall promotional spending by 25-30% while shifting to segment-specific strategies:**\n",
        "- PROTECT high-value, low-promo customers (offer convenience, not discounts)\n",
        "- REWARD smart shoppers selectively (personalized, premium-focused offers)\n",
        "- REDUCE subsidies to margin killers (basket minimums, category restrictions)\n",
        "- ATTRACT missing affluent demographics (experience over price)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Expected Impact:** ~$230,000 annual savings in promotional costs while maintaining or improving revenue from high-value segments. Pilot approach manages risk with 90-day test before full rollout.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Strategic Shift:** From volume-focused (attract everyone) to value-focused (attract the right customers).\n",

        "\n",
        "Promotions cost money. Every discount dollar represents potential margin erosion. But promotions \n",
        "also drive traffic, build loyalty, and can attract high-value customers. The question is: **which \n",
        "customers are we attracting with our promotions?**\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Hypothesis A: \"Margin Killers\"**  \n",
        "Promotion-heavy households are price-sensitive cherry-pickers who:\n",
        "- Only shop during sales\n",
        "- Buy low-margin items\n",
        "- Have small basket sizes\n",
        "- Would defect to competitors for better deals\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hypothesis B: \"Smart Shoppers\"**  \n",
        "Promotion-heavy households are savvy, high-value customers who:\n",
        "- Use promotions strategically but still spend significantly\n",
        "- Buy premium products at a discount\n",
        "- Have large basket sizes\n",
        "- Are loyal if we keep engaging them with targeted offers\n",
        "\n",
        "### Our Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "We will analyze 1.47M transactions across 801 households to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Define promotion intensity** using discount usage and coupon redemptions\n",
        "2. **Segment households** into a 2×2 matrix:\n",
        "   - Promotion usage (heavy vs. light)\n",
        "   - Spending level (high vs. low)\n",
        "3. **Identify \"smart shoppers\"** (high promotion + high spending)\n",
        "4. **Analyze demographic patterns** (income, kids, household size)\n",
